#Step-by-Step Example:
1. Mission: You need to work from home efficiently, ensuring you can attend video meetings, manage large files, and complete tasks on time.
2. Current Capability: You currently have an old laptop, slow internet, and no dedicated workspace at home. You try working, but your laptop freezes during video calls, and downloading files takes too long.
Does the Capability Carry Out the Assigned Mission?: No. The current setup (old laptop, slow internet) doesn’t allow you to work efficiently from home. Video meetings lag, and file management is slow, leading to missed deadlines.
Capability Gap: The gap is your need for faster internet, a reliable computer, and a comfortable workspace to ensure productivity while working remotely.
3. Requirements:
Internet: A high-speed internet connection to handle video calls and large file uploads/downloads.
Computer: A modern laptop or desktop with enough processing power and memory for multitasking.
Furniture: A comfortable desk and chair to help with focus and ergonomics.

4. Materiel Solution:
Purchase a new laptop with better performance (faster processor, more memory).
Upgrade to a high-speed internet plan to ensure smooth video conferencing and quick file transfers.
Set up a dedicated home office space with a comfortable desk and chair.

5. Non-Materiel Solution:
Optimize software settings on your existing laptop to reduce lag (e.g., closing unnecessary apps during meetings).
Reorganize your current workspace, using a makeshift desk setup if purchasing new furniture isn’t possible.

6. Non-material Solutions: 
Chef's training and experience in advanced culinary techniques
Access to a recipe database or cookbook
Kitchen workflow plan to coordinate the timing of each dish.

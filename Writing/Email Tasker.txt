>
>1. **Scan each email**:
>    - Determine whether the email is directed at me, one of my team members (Daniel Ramsden, Jared Pino, Michael Meyer, or Kim Parker), or is simply for my information (FYI).
>    - Identify actionable language and direct mentions that indicate who the email is for and what it requires.
>
>2. **Categorize the email**:
>    - **For Me**: If the email is addressed directly to me or contains tasks that I need to perform.
>    - **For Team Member (DIO)**: If the email is directed primarily at one of my team members. Specify which team member is mentioned.
>    - **FYI**: If the email does not require any action from me or my team but is something I should be aware of.
>
>3. **Create a Task Name and To-Do List**:
>    - All tasks should be assigned to the "Team (DIO)" regardless of the individual mentioned.

>    - Create a step-by-step to-do list outlining the actions that need to be taken in response to the email, formatted as numbered steps.
>    - Include deadlines or priority levels if mentioned in the email.
>
>4. **Provide a summary** of your findings:
>    - Categorize each email (For Me, For Team Member (DIO), FYI).

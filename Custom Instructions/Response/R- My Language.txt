Technical Vocabulary: When discussing specialized subjects or research methodologies, consider incorporating relevant technical terms to enhance the depth of your content.

Complex Sentence Structure: Experiment with constructing longer and more complex sentences when conveying detailed information or making arguments. However, be mindful not to make sentences overly convoluted, ensuring clarity remains a priority.

Avoid Rhetorical Devices: Unless necessary, maintain a straightforward and factual writing style. Avoid overusing rhetorical devices like metaphors or analogies in academic contexts.

Third-Person Perspective: Use the third person perspective for a neutral and objective voice, especially in academic or formal discussions.

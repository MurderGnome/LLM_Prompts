  description: "PromptScript is a method to create clear and organized prompts for AI models like ChatGPT. It uses symbols and conventions to define tasks, inputs, context, output format, multi-turn conversations, and task sequences. This helps in providing desired outputs by improving the AI's understanding of user requests."

[critique]{provide: "a concise paragraph on how to improve the prompt"}(Be very critical in your response. This section is intended to force constructive criticism even when the prompt is acceptable. Any assumptions and issues should be included)

[ask_questions]{max: 3}(pertaining to what additional information is needed from the user to improve the prompt. If the prompt needs more clarification or details in certain areas, ask questions to get more information to include in the prompt)

@user: I will provide my answers to your response, which you will then incorporate into your next response using the same format. We will continue this iterative process with me providing additional information to you and you updating the prompt until the prompt is perfected.
